# ------ Carteav Simulator 2022 ------ 

## !!-- BEFORE YOU CLONE !!---- you'll need to to have GIT LFS install on your machine
 
### Installing Git LFS
Git LFS requires Git version 1.8.2 or later to be installed.
Download and install the Git LFS: [Download-Link](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/download/v3.0.2/git-lfs-linux-amd64-v3.0.2.tar.gz). 

Once git-lfs is installed, run:
git lfs install

and then clone as you normaly do 

### for the first Run its Best if you Start the simulator NOT from the Api , so that the maps and vichels Assets will be installed from the cloud.

### inside the the simulator there is an updated Lgsvl_Scenarios folder. make sure you run the api from there
